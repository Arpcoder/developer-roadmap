# Data Engineering Roadmap

Data engineering is a crucial discipline that involves collecting, storing, and processing data to make it accessible for analysis and business intelligence. Whether you're just starting or looking to expand your skills, this roadmap will guide you through the foundational knowledge and practical projects necessary to become a proficient data engineer.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into data engineering, ensure you have a strong foundation in the following areas:

- **Programming**: Proficiency in Python or Java is highly recommended.
- **Database Basics**: Understand fundamental concepts of relational databases, SQL, and NoSQL databases.
- **Linux/UNIX**: Familiarity with the command line and basic shell scripting.
