# Competitve Programming Roadmap
## What is Competitive Programming
 Competitive Programming… It teaches you how to think? Once you enter in programming you just don’t learn how to code but you also learn the “art of thinking”, by breaking your code into smaller chunks and then using your logic-based creativity to solve a problem from different angles. Programming is fun, programming is an exercise for your brain, programming is a mental sport and when this sport is held on the internet involving sports programmer as a contestant, then it is called Competitive Programming.

 ## Pre-Requisite for Competitive Programming 
 * Choose a Language: Select a programming language that you are comfortable with. Common choices include C++, Java, and Python. C++ is a popular choice in competitive programming due to its speed and powerful standard library.
* Basic Algorithms: Understand and implement fundamental algorithms like sorting (quicksort, mergesort), searching (binary search), and basic dynamic programming.
* Data Structures: Familiarize yourself with essential data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, and graphs. Understand when and how to use each data structure.
  
## Benefits of Competitive Programming 
* Improves Problem-Solving Skills
* Boosts Coding Speed and Accuracy
* Helps in clearing coding rounds of software companies
* Provides Recognition and Opportunities
