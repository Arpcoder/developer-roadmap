### What is Android Compose?

Android Compose is a modern UI toolkit for building native Android user interfaces using a declarative approach. Unlike the traditional XML-based layout system, Compose lets you define your app's UI in a more intuitive and efficient way.

Compose is a very intutive  way of writing drawable  UI components, directly in your activity, using declarative syntax!

```Kotlin
@Composable
fun calcUI() {
    //
}
```

Whether you're a newcomer or a seasoned developer, Android Compose offers exciting possibilities for building beautiful and dynamic Android apps. Let's embark on this journey together, as we explore the world of Android Compose from novice to expert.



# Android Compose and Jetpack Integration: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the world of Android Compose and Jetpack, where the art of building modern, dynamic, and efficient Android applications meets the power of a rich set of libraries and components. This comprehensive guide is your gateway to understanding the seamless integration of Android Compose with Jetpack, catering to developers of all skill levels.

### Understanding Android Compose

Android Compose is a revolutionary UI toolkit that reimagines the way we create Android user interfaces. Unlike the traditional XML-based layout system, Compose uses a declarative syntax to define your app's UI. This means you describe what your UI should look like based on the current state of your app, and Compose takes care of rendering it efficiently. With Compose, you can create beautiful, responsive, and interactive user interfaces with less code and more flexibility.

### The Power of Jetpack

Android Jetpack is a suite of libraries, tools, and guidance provided by Google to help developers build high-quality Android apps more easily. It offers a set of pre-built, modular components that handle common Android tasks like navigation, data persistence, and UI design. Jetpack components are designed to work seamlessly with Compose, making it easier than ever to build robust Android apps.

### Why Combine Compose and Jetpack?

The combination of Android Compose and Jetpack is a match made in developer heaven. Here's why:

- **Productivity**: Compose's declarative syntax simplifies UI development, while Jetpack handles the underlying architecture, saving you time and effort.

- **Consistency**: Jetpack components promote best practices and provide a consistent app structure, ensuring your app is stable and maintainable.

- **Flexibility**: Compose allows you to customize your UI as much as you want, and Jetpack components adapt effortlessly to your design choices.

- **Performance**: Compose and Jetpack work together to optimize app performance, resulting in smooth and efficient user experiences.

### What You'll Discover in This Guide

This guide is designed to take you on a journey from the fundamentals to the advanced techniques of combining Android Compose with Jetpack. Here's a sneak peek of what you'll explore:

1. **Getting Started**: If you're new to Compose or Jetpack, we'll gently introduce you to the basics, ensuring you have a strong foundation.

2. **Compose Essentials**: Dive into the core concepts of Compose, including Composables, layouts, theming, and state management.

3. **Jetpack Integration**: Explore how Compose seamlessly integrates with popular Jetpack libraries like Navigation, ViewModel, Room, and LiveData.

4. **Building Real Apps**: Work on practical projects where you'll apply Compose and Jetpack principles to create real-world Android applications.

5. **Advanced Topics**: For experienced developers, we'll cover advanced topics such as performance optimization, custom Composables, and testing.

6. **Best Practices**: Throughout the guide, we'll share best practices and tips to help you create maintainable and efficient code.

### Let's Embark on the Journey

Whether you're a newcomer looking to build your first Android app or an experienced developer eager to embrace the future of Android development, this guide will equip you with the knowledge and skills to create stunning, responsive, and feature-rich Android applications. Let's dive into the exciting world of Android Compose and Jetpack integration!

# Level 0 - Hello World!
In this Unit, we are going to build a hello world app! 
For this we will need to setup android studio, and get  
you on-board and familiar with kotlin!

So Let's go!!!


## Prerequisites

- Intermediate computer skills, including understanding file structure and using moderately complex applications, such as a spreadsheet, word processor, and photo editor.
- Computer navigation skills, so that you can open and adjust settings and identify browser and operating system (OS) versions.
Ability to verify system requirements (disk and memory space requirements, and screen resolution), and to download, install, and update software.
## What you'll Learn
- How to create an Android App with Android Studio
- How to run apps with the Preview tool in Android Studio
- How to update text with Kotlin
- How to update a User Interface (UI) with Jetpack Compose
- How to see a preview of your app with Preview in
   Jetpack   Compose 

### Let's get started:

Here is what we will build for a quick hands on, a scaffold with a name display, it might sound boring, but it  is just the right stuff, to get started! 

![project-target](https://developer.android.com/static/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-first-app/img/13957184d295b16f_960.png)

### Step 1 
open Android Studio and Create a new project!

![android studio welcome Screen](https://developer.android.com/static/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-first-app/img/ae56cae7df0e4f09_960.png)

### Step 2 
Choose an empty Activity in the new project window
![New Project windwow](https://developer.android.com/static/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-first-app/img/935c2d9a4df8b864_960.png)
In Android Studio, a project template is an Android project that provides the blueprint for a certain type of app. Templates create the structure of the project and the files needed for Android Studio to build your project. The template that you choose provides starter code to get you going faster.

- Make sure the Phone and Tablet tab is selected.
- Click the Empty Activity template to select it as the template for your project. 
- The Empty Activity template is the template to create a simple project that you can use to build a Compose app. It has a single screen and displays the text "Hello Android!".
Click Next.

The New Project dialog opens. This has some fields to configure your project.

### Step 3 
Configure your project as follows:
- The Name field is used to enter the name of your project, for this codelab type "Greeting Card".

- Leave the Package name field as is. This is how your files will be organized in the file structure. In this case, the package name will be com.example.greetingcard.

- Leave the Save location field as is. It contains the location where all the files related to your project are saved. Take a note of where that is on your computer so that you can find your files.

- Select API 24: Android 7.0 (Nougat) from the menu in the Minimum SDK field. Minimum SDK indicates the minimum version of Android that your app can run on.

![Project configuration ](https://developer.android.com/static/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-first-app/img/c860e875eefd68b7_960.png)

Click Finish. This may take a while - this is a great time to get a cup of tea! While Android Studio is setting up, a progress bar and message indicates whether Android Studio is still setting up your project. It may look like this:

![GRADLE](https://developer.android.com/static/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-first-app/img/3558f61a535db5d1_960.png)

While, your project gets configured by the gradle build tools, let's get you familiar with your Developement enviorment...
 - You may see a What's New pane which contains updates on new features in Android Studio. Close it for now.
  ![](https://developer.android.com/static/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-first-app/img/6a39d1ad2c904a64_960.png)
- Click Split on the top right of Android Studio, this allows you to view both code and design. You can also click Code to view code only or click Design to view design only.
  ![code/split/design Pane](https://developer.android.com/static/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-first-app/img/b19824b6bdd2eb0e_960.png)

  - After pressing Split you should see three areas:
